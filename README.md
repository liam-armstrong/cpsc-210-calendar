### Calendar Personal Project
#### UBC CPSC 210 Winter Term 1 Term Project

For UBC Computer Science's "Software Construction" course (CPSC 210) the students are required to complete a project of their own design, making weekly contributions based on the week's coursework. We had weekly "deliverables", all which were satisfied by this project for a perfect assignment grade

**Deliverable 1: Basic Interaction**
> Get basic interaction loop going, use at least one class, and must have multiple methods that are called. 

**Deliverable 2: Abstraction and Testing**
> In this phase, you are to decide on at least one data abstraction (a Class) that captures the central element (or elements, if you want, but you need at least one) of your system. Write a separate class that tests every method your data abstraction or data abstractions. 

**Deliverable 3: Types, Interfaces and Saving**
> You need to save the state of your class or classes to a file, and be able to re-load the state of the class or classes from a file (so that a user can keep going where they left off).  Write tests that ensure the file load and save methods are functioning correctly.

> You must introduce at least two interfaces, and have one class that implement at least two interfaces.

> You need to write tests for the methods in the interfaces. It's up to you whether you make specific test classes for each interface, or, as is more common in industry, augment the testing of the implementation class to cover the Interface methods.

**Deliverable 4: Abstracts and Extends**
> You must introduce at least one abstract class. The abstract class should have at least one abstract method. Extend this abstract class with at least 2 classes

**Deliverable 5: Robustness**
> Create an multiple exceptions and an exception hierarchy with multiple levels of try/catch statements

**Deliverable 7: Draw Out Your Design**
> Draw a UML class diagram of your system. Include all the classes in your system, all type-hierarchy relationships and associations. Include all methods in every class box. Choose one starting method and draw a sequence diagram of its execution

**Deliverable 8: Data Relationships**
> Setup a reflexive relationship within your system. Override equals and hashcode to make this work.

**Deliverable 9: Design Principles**
> Do a cohesion analysis of your system to identify areas of low cohesion. Refactor those classes to be cohesive. Do a coupling analysis of the central classes of your system. Refactor those classes if there is a lot of coupling between classes. Use delegation if you've found methods violating LSP

**Deliverable 10: Design Patterns and the Web**
> Implement the Observer or Composite design pattern within your system

> Parse JSON or XML data from an external API 

**Deliverable 11: Interactivity and Visuals**
> Add a GUI. Incorporate UI elements such as buttons, and text boxes, a map, creative use of sounds, or visualisations, as appropriate for your application.  Make creative use of visualisation where you can.
